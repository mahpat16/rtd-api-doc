Tiyaro Model API Documentation
==============================

**Tiyaro Model API** (/lu'make/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers
that creates recipes mixing random ingredients.
It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

**Tiyaro** makes AI/ML models available as API. Our goal is to make AI/ML accessible to all developers. 
Developers can use the model explorer to discover models based on their use case (twitter sentiment analysis, 
forest fires, faces etc), the name of the model (effecientnet, bert, gpt2, etc), model 
framework (Tensorflow, PyTorch, XGBoost) or model author.  All models found on Tiyaro are 
instantly available for use as an API. As of this writing there are 14,320 models from 2,843 
authors/publishers. 

Developers do not have to worry about provisioning these models, you just use them as you need and you pay 
for only what you use. Every developer also gets generous amounts of ‘free credits’ to explore the Tiyaro 
Universe.

This Guide is for developers trying to use the Tiyaro Model API in their application.
