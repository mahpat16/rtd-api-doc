Service Tier
------------
The following service tiers are supported for each API. Service tiers define the backend that will service your API call and the infrastructure used to run your model inference.

* cpu_flex 
cpu_flex is the **default** service tier for each API. This service tier means that your API will be served by one of our cpu backends.

* gpu_flex
If you add the query param serviceTier=gpu_flex to an API endpoint your API will use the gpu_flex tier. This service tier means that your API will be served by one of backends running on a gpu.
